# Dinooo

![Dino <3s you](https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmc5DiXa54PRMm5Yd2pQ9vfMHepaaYuvLzafyicfBkZ2TK/U5drQkLepB9H3aa3dmvhBTG2TAfjUU9.gif)

A bot that plays Chrome's offline runner minigame. For when you're so bored you want to spend the day watching a bot beat its own high score while cheering for a cute pixel dinosaur.

## Usage

- Open [chrome://dino](chrome://dino)
- Open console (F12)
- Copy the contents of `dino.js` to the console & hit enter
- Be happy

## Roadmap

- [x] Self-start instead of waiting for user input
- [ ] Make into Chrome extension (obviously important)
- [ ] Improve decision making until it can reliably break the score counter (also business-critical)
